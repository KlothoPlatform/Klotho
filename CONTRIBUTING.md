## Signing the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

For first-time contributors, we require you to sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your contributions. This agreement ensures that you're granting the project the right to use and distribute your contributions under the terms of the project's open-source license.

We use [CLA Assistant](https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant) to manage and track CLA signatures. When you submit your first pull request, a bot will automatically check if you have signed the CLA. If you haven't, you will receive a comment with a link to sign the CLA online.

Please follow these steps to sign the CLA:

1. Click the link provided in the bot's comment on your pull request.
2. Review the CLA document and ensure you understand the terms.
3. Sign the CLA by providing your name, email address, and GitHub username.
4. Once you've signed the CLA, the bot will update the status of your pull request, and the project maintainers can proceed with reviewing your contribution.

Note: You only need to sign the CLA once. After signing, your CLA signature will apply to all your future contributions to the project.

### Bug Fixes and New Features

1. Identify an issue to work on or create a new issue for the feature or bug fix you'd like to contribute.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear and descriptive commit message.
4. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name` or `git push origin fix/your-fix-name`.
5. Create a pull request (PR) from your fork to the main Klotho repository.
    - Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in your PR.
    - Reference the issue number that your PR addresses (e.g., "Fixes #123").
6. Wait for a project maintainer to review your PR. They may request changes or provide feedback before merging your changes.
